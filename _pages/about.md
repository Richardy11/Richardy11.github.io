I am enthusiastic about pursuing opportunities in biomedical engineering and bridging the gap between the nervous system and machines. For this purpose, I pursue double majours in **electrical engineering** and **neuroscience** to deepen my understanding of neuronal signal interpretation and its translation to devices. Currently, my research revolves around implantable devices, spike sorting, and neural reinnervation surguries. I also have extensive experience in myoelectric-controlled neuroprosthetics, EMG decoding, and spinal cord injury rehabilitation.

Neuroengineering has been a long-standing passion, sparked during high school when I volunteered at a rehabilitation center in Beijing. Since then, I have dedicated myself to advancing research in neuroengineering, with the goal of making meaningful contributions to this impactful and exciting field.

I am enthusiastic about pursuing opportunities in biomedical engineering and bridging the gap between the nervous system and machines. To acheive this goal, I trained in **electrical engineering** and **neuroscience** to develop a strong foundation in neural signal interpretation and its translation to devices. My current research focuses on implantable neural interfaces, spike sorting, and motor reinnervation surgeries. I also bring extensive experience in myoelectric-controlled neuroprosthetics, EMG decoding, and spinal cord injury rehabilitation.

My interest in neuroengineering began in high school while volunteering at a rehabilitation center in Beijing. Since then, I have remained committed to advancing the field, driven by a desire to restore human function and deepen our understanding of biology through technology.

I am enthusiastic about pursuing opportunities in biomedical engineering and bridging the gap between the nervous system and machines. For this purpose, I pursue double majours in electrical engineering and neuroscience to deepen my understanding of neuronal signal interpretation and its translation to devices. Currently, my research revolves around implantable devices, spike sorting, and neural reinnervation surguries. I also have extensive experience in myoelectric-controlled neuroprosthetics, EMG decoding, and spinal cord injury rehabilitation.

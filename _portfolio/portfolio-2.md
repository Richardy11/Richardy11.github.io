title: "Processing and Evaluation Pipeline for Neuromodulation of Respiratory Muscles"
excerpt: "This project improves myoelectric prosthesis control through a novel 3D visual feedback system called **Reviewer**, which allows users to visualize their EMG signals in real-time. This system helps users understand how their muscle activity influences the machine learning algorithms underlying control. By providing intuitive visual feedback, it mitigates challenges such as steep learning curves and misclassifications, enabling users to produce clearer, more consistent signals and ultimately enhancing the usability of neuroprosthetics. <br/><img src='/images/3D_System.png'>"

Overview
======
State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyogprahy (EMG) signals into desired movements. As the number of possible prosthesis movements increase, users have difficulty generating sufficiently separable EMG signals that reliably operate all possible degrees of freedom Current training regimens attempt to increase the separability of a user’s EMG signals through trial and error, wherein a practitioner prompts a user to generate EMG signals and provides advice based on the strength and channel distribution of the EMG. We introduce a novel visual feedback interface, the **Reviewer**, which projects incoming EMG data into the classification space of the underlying decoder, enabling intuitive visualization of the pattern recognition (PR) algorithm’s behavior.

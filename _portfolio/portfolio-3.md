title: "Manufacturing of a Multi-Function Implantable Microcontroller: Recorder, Stimulator, and Wireless Charger"
excerpt: "The Bionode is a compact, all-in-one implantable device combining a **recorder, stimulator, and wireless charger**, designed by Professor Pedro Irazoquiâ€™s lab. Engineered for implantation, the device's versatility and small size make it ideal for advanced studies in neuromuscular function. This project focuses on adapting and manufacturing the Bionode to record Electromyography (EMG) data from rats' soleus muscles, enabling real-time data transmission to a PC for **wavelet compression and detailed analysis of motor unit activity**, supporting advancements in neuroengineering research. <br/><img src='/images/bionode_schematics.png'>"

Overview
======
The Bionode microcontroller required essential modifications to meet neuromuscular research needs. Initially, its limited frequency range could not capture the full EMG spectrum. To address this, the frequency range was **expanded to 5 Hz to 3000 Hz** by redesigning core components. Now equipped for **wireless transmission**, the Bionode is set to begin EMG signal testing soon, leading up to deployment in a biological setting for extensive testing and its application in advanced EMG implants research.

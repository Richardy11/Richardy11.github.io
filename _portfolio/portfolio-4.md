title: "Processing and Evaluation Pipeline for Neuromodulation of Respiratory Muscles"
excerpt: "Respiratory complications are a leading cause of death in patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), significantly affecting their quality of life. **Neuromodulation**, a promising therapeutic approach, involves the use of electrical stimulation to modulate nerve activity, aiming to enhance respiratory function in these patients. To support this effort, a comprehensive MATLAB pipeline was developed to **automatically detect, analyze, and compare electromyography (EMG) properties** in SCI patients undergoing neuromodulation therapy. By enhancing the understanding of how neuromodulation influences respiratory function in chronic SCI patients, this tool contributes to the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed at alleviating respiratory complications in this population. <br/><img src='/images/Pipeline_Demo.png'>"

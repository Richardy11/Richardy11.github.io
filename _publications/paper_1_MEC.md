title: "Patter Seperability Visual Feedback To Improve Pattern Recogntion Decoding Performance"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/MEC24_paper_52
excerpt: 'MEC is a triennial symposium of special interest to those who work in the fields of upper limb prosthetics and myoelectric control (including upper and lower limb), recognized worldwide for its pioneering work in myoelectric controls. This paper reports significant improvements in subjects using 3D feedback for pattern recognition over traditional training, measured by completion rate, trial overshoot, efficiency, and throughput. Retention tests 30 days post-trial suggest potential long-term benefits of 3D feedback. Future studies will include recalibration frequency, training time, and amputee trials, with findings to be published in a journal extension.'

State-of-the-art myoelectric upper limb prostheses control often utilize pattern recognition (PR) systems that translate electromyograph (EMG) activity to a desired movement. As possible prosthesis movements increase, users have difficulty generating sufficiently separable EMG signals that reliably operate all possible degrees of freedom. Current training regimens attempt to increase the separability of a userâ€™s EMG signals through trial-and-error, where a therapist prompts a user to generate EMG signals and provides advice based on the strength and channel distribution of the EMG. In this work, we present a novel visual feedback interface that allows users to observe how their EMG signals affect PR output directly.

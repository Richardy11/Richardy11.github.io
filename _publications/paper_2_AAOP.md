excerpt: 'The AAOP Annual Meeting and Scientific Symposium is the preeminent yearly forum for O&P professionals to gather with colleagues to explore and discuss the current and future prospects for the O&P profession. The Annual Meeting program offers outstanding clinical, technical, pedorthic, mastectomy, and professional development programming, with a focus on evidence-based practice. This paper presents preliminary findings demonstrating the potential of 3D visual feedback for enhancing pattern recognition in prosthetic control. Our initial studies reveal significant improvements in completion rates compared to traditional training methods. Future research will conduct more extensive experiments, comparing a comprehensive range of metrics across both our proposed solution and existing methods of prosthesis control.'

Myoelectric prostheses are often controlled via pattern recognition (PR) algorithms that translate surface electromyograph (EMG) activity into motor outputs [1]. Prosthesis users often require extensive training to consistently generate distinguishable EMG patterns of activity for prosthesis operation [2]; however, current training paradigms do not provide individuals with enough feedback to modulate EMG activity to accomplish these goals in an informed manner. To aid in the process, we present the results of a real-time feedback visualization method that presents prosthesis users with a projection of their EMG activity into the classification-space defined by a user’s PR system.

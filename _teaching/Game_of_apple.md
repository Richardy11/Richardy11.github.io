***Apples!***


🍎🍎🍎
======
I sit facing another person, a scale placed between us on the table. We each have a box containing three apples, and another apple rests quietly at the center, enticing us both—each eager to claim it. The rule is simple: whoever places more apples on their side tips the balance, sending all the apples rolling toward them. Our eyes meet, and the contest begins.


Chapter One: How Many Apples Do I Have?
======
**“Three is three”**, a truth deceptively simple yet surprisingly elusive. Our boxes are opaque, their contents hidden; without directly checking or feeling inside, certainty remains beyond reach.

At times, filled with unwarranted confidence, I imagine myself holding six apples. Boldly, I announce, “You have only three, right? Fine, I'll place four!” But when I reach inside, I discover just two apples, while my opponent has already confidently placed three. The scale tilts in his favor, apples rolling away from me.

Other times, insecurity overtakes me, and I mistakenly assume I have just one apple: “He has three, I can't possibly win.” Paralyzed by doubt, I place nothing, allowing the central apple to roll naturally toward him.

I think I'm carefully weighing the risks, yet in truth, **I’m uncertain even of what I hold in my own hands**.



Chapter Two: Three Apples? Are You Sure?
======
Now, I firmly know I have three apples. Yet another worry surfaces: **What if I lose them all?** 

We're used to measuring our worth by apples, as though losing them would mean absolute defeat. A deeper anxiety emerges: these apples have become a part of me. They're more than mere tokens; they embody my sense of security, proof of my existence, intertwined inseparably with my identity. **If I lose them, am I still myself?**

Cautiously, I decide to hold onto at least one apple as insurance, hoping my opponent feels the same hesitation. With careful deliberation, I place two apples onto the scale. But my opponent, utterly fearless, throws down all three apples, laughing boldly: “Who cares about apples anyway! Ha ha ha!” Instantly, the scale tips, and all the apples roll toward him.

He claims victory, **leaving me holding just my single, safeguarded apple**.



Chapter Three: The Scale? What Scale?
======
Resolutely, I place all three apples onto the scale. Surely, I can't lose this time—at worst, it will end in a draw. Yet just as victory feels certain, my opponent flashes a mischievous grin and abruptly flips the scale over, leaving me stunned.

**He could do that???**

I stare at the scattered apples, frustration simmering quietly within me. I had meticulously adhered to the rules, only to discover they could be casually tossed aside. **The scale's authority existed solely because we chose to honor it.**

My patience, already stretched thin by repeated setbacks, finally snaps. Abandoning all pretense of fairness, I ignore the overturned scale and charge at my opponent, fists flying. Those around us, watching in shock, quickly join the fray. Soon, scales everywhere topple, plunging the scene into chaos as apples scatter in every direction.

The rules of the scale are abandoned entirely—now, **<span style="color:red;">it is survival of the fittest</span>**.



Chapter Four: That Guy Has Plenty of Apples, Should We...?
======
Exhausted and bruised, we pause, silently surveying the aftermath of our chaotic brawl. Sitting back down, breathing heavily, we glance around and realize **the guy across from us still holds plenty of apples, while my brothers and I have hardly any left**.

Staring at the empty scale, we whisper among ourselves: “We can't win if we keep fighting individually. Maybe we should... **team up?**” As our opponent busies himself sorting his apples, we secretly gather, arming ourselves with sticks and exchanging meaningful glances. The moment he turns his back, we're ready to strike!

But just as we lunge forward, he urgently shouts, “Guys, stop!” Raising his head to meet our eyes, he focuses directly on me: “You only have one apple left, don't you? Listen, let’s return to the scale. If I win three apples, I'll give you one. With just a single apple, you can't even afford to keep playing. We can either continue this endless chaos or play **'fairly'** together at the scale.”

I hesitate—I don’t really want violence; **I’m just afraid of losing my place in the game**. Using this **“three-for-one”** strategy, he gradually persuades my comrades to join his side, one by one. Ultimately, we find ourselves back at the scale, forced to acknowledge that no matter how fiercely we fight, we cannot succeed alone.

Only after securing more than half of us in his “fair deal” does he smile coldly, surveying those remaining. “We don't need them,” he declares confidently. “They pose no threat.” The game resumes, **but now it's one group against another**.


Chapter Five: The Apple Tree
======
Suddenly, I realize **my opponent has vanished**.

While we remain engrossed in our endless apple battles around the scale, I glance up and spot him in the nearby barren field, shovel in hand, **carefully digging and watering the soil**. “Planting an apple tree?” I call out mockingly. “That land is dry—nothing will ever grow there! Come back and compete!” He ignores us, continuing his task with steadfast determination, while we persist in our fruitless rounds of apple contests.

Many seeds he plants fail to sprout; countless seedlings wither and die halfway. But eventually, a single seedling emerges, growing steadily into a **magnificent tree**, heavy with hundreds of apples. People gather beneath its branches, marveling at its abundant fruits.

 **<span style="color:orange;">Sword in hand</span>**, he proclaims, while the keepers of the scale look on in fear: “There’s no need to fight over apples anymore! I need helpers to water this tree-when watered, it thrives. Before, you fought bitterly just to win **one apple**; now, simply watering this tree once will reward you with **two**. Any takers?”

Slowly but surely, the crowd shifted. The scale remains standing, but fewer people gather around it. More and more begin planting and watering trees. **Those who remain obsessed with the scale seem to have forgotten that every apple they ever fought for originally grew on a tree**.

There will always be those who stake everything on the scale, those who overturn it completely, **<span style="color:skyblue;">and those who once again picks up the shovel</span>**.

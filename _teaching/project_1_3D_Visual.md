The project enhances myoelectric prosthesis control with a novel 3D visual feedback system called **Reviewer**, which allows users to see their EMG signals in real-time. This helps them understand how their muscle activity affects control. In a 10-session study with 12 participants, the Reviewer outperformed standard virtual feedback, improving accuracy and adaptability. By offering intuitive visual feedback, it addresses issues like the steep learning curve and misclassifications, enabling users to generate clearer, more consistent signals, ultimately enhancing prosthetic control.

Amputees using myoelectric prostheses struggle with intuitive control due to inconsistent and indistinct muscle signals (EMG), leading to frequent misclassifications and control errors. This steep learning curve limits the effectiveness of prosthetics for daily use. Despite advancements in control algorithms, improvements in real-world performance—particularly control accuracy—remain limited. While pattern recognition algorithms perform well in controlled environments, they fail to account for the non-stationary nature of EMG signals in real-life settings. This disconnect between laboratory and real-world results contributes to high prosthetic rejection rates. Ultimately, changing control algorithms alone has done little to solve these practical issues, shifting the focus toward improving robustness and real-time adaptability.
